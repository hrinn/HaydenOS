Then it don’t matter. I’ll be all around in the dark – I’ll be everywhere. 
Wherever you can look – wherever there’s a fight, so hungry people can eat, 
I’ll be there. Wherever there’s a cop beatin’ up a guy, I’ll be there. I’ll be
in the way guys yell when they’re mad. I’ll be in the way kids laugh when 
they’re hungry and they know supper’s ready, and when the people are eatin’ 
the stuff they raise and livin’ in the houses they build – I’ll be there, too.
